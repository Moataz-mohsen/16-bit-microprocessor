## CPU Design Overview
This repository contains detailed documentation and resources related to a comprehensive CPU design. The provided diagram offers an insightful look into the various components and their interactions within a basic computer processor. This README will guide you through the key elements of the design and their functions.

# Components Overview

- **Registers (Reg0 to Reg7)
Description: Small, fast storage locations directly accessible by the CPU.
Purpose: Hold intermediate data and provide quick data manipulation.

- **Program Counter (ProgCnt)
Description: Keeps track of the address of the next instruction to be executed.
Purpose: Ensures the CPU processes instructions sequentially.

- **Address Register (AddrReg)
Description: Holds the memory address of data to be accessed or stored.
Purpose: Acts as a bridge between the CPU and memory.

- **Instruction Register (InstrReg)
Description: Temporarily holds the current instruction being executed.
Purpose: Allows the CPU to decode and process instructions.

- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
Description: The heart of the CPU, performing arithmetic and logical operations.
Purpose: Executes operations essential for data processing.

- **Shifter
Description: Performs shift operations on data.
Purpose: Essential for bitwise manipulation of data.

- **Control Unit
Description: Manages and coordinates the activities of the CPU.
Purpose: Sends control signals to other components based on the instruction being executed.
